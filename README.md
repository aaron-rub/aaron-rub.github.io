## Project progression

<!-- .slide vertical=true -->

- **My current plan**, Add HTML page for curency coverter and convert home page to match with the theme of the project. I also would like to convert the hacks that I was given and turn them from java to pyhton so that I could learn more about code. Talk to mort about my progress by myself and go over paramaters of the final. Also add a new feature that relates to the currency conversion page.

- **HTML page**, Attempting
- **Hacks Conversion**, Converted matrix hacks, check nav bar to see conversion.
- **Brainstorm new feature**, Not done with first feature yet
