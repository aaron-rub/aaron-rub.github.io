- During Night of the mueseum it gave me the opprotunity to view others projects, and use them to brainstorm ideas for my own project. Not only was I able to gain ideas but also some of them shared their work process and work ethic which I used to make my own work ethic that was efficient for me. I also took the time to view the CSA projects and see how they are doing and the expetations for them.
